Sharme is a remote/sharing desktop tool that lets you to connect
to a remote system or share your desktop.

The name comes from a combination of "share me" and the
portuguese word "charme" meaning charm. I guess "charme"
is also a *valid* word in german and french with the same meaning.

It was born because I regularly need to support remote users.
So I start it in june 2011 and one month later I was already using it,
internaly, at the company I work for.

Since I developed it to do a single job and it is doing
well, at least for me, I decide to open source it in the hope
of getting help from talent developers to leverage the quality
of this simple app or at least pointing me at some mistakes I may had
made.

The other reason is because I'm a true beliver in the open source
culture and using open source to develop it, it make sense to open
source it too.

I releasing it under [GPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) license.

Why did not use VNC, TeamViewer or others?
Well, it's the usual, it's more fun to develop and use my own.
