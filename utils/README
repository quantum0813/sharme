makegui
-------

Small program to set/unset the gui flag in Win32 executables.

In other words a small utility to avoid or not the command prompt window
appear when running an executable.

I get it from SWFTools source tree.


Runnig it
---------

If you have TinyC compiler you can run it as it would be a shell script

$ ./makegui.c


Compile
-------

If you want to compile, just remove the first line (the called shebang)
and then just do:

$ make
