    <h1>sharme - about</h1>
    <p>Sharme is a remote/sharing desktop tool that lets you to connect
to a remote system or share your desktop.</p>
<p>The name comes from a combination of "share me" and the
portuguese word "charme" meaning charm. I guess "charme"
is also a <em>valid</em> word in german and french with the same meaning.</p>
<p>It was born because I regularly need to support remote users.
So I start it in june 2011 and one month later I was already using it,
internaly, at the company I work for.</p>
<p>Since I developed it to do a single job and it is doing
well, at least for me, I decide to open source it in the hope
of getting help from talent developers to leverage the quality
of this simple app or at least pointing me at some mistakes I may had
made.</p>
<p>The other reason is because I'm a true beliver in the open source
culture and using open source to develop it, it make sense to open
source it too.</p>
<p>I releasing it under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPLv2</a> license.</p>
<p>Why did not use VNC, TeamViewer or others?
Well, it's the usual, it's more fun to develop and use my own.</p>
